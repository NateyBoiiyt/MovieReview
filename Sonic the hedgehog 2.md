Movie: Sonic the Hedgehog 2

Review: It was kind of cringe, being a family movie it had its moments. But seeing the film was entertaining nonetheless. There were some really cool references to the games I played as a kid. I was a really big fan of the retro sonic games and some elements of the games were present in the movie, although they did not feature the famous red plane that much which was saddening to me. Though the movie also focuses on Sonic too much, the movie was nice to sit through.
